# 💤 Sleep Analysis and Sleep Stage Classification using Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a deep learning pipeline for **sleep stage classification** using **physiological signals** extracted from Polysomnography (PSG) data. It involves signal preprocessing, segmentation, label alignment, and training a **CNN-LSTM hybrid model** to classify sleep stages such as Wake, N1, N2, N3 (Deep Sleep), and REM.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🔬 **Multi-signal Input**: Utilizes EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, and respiration signals from `.edf` files.
- 🧼 **Signal Preprocessing**: Applies bandpass filtering to remove noise based on modality-specific frequency ranges.
- 🧩 **Epoch-based Segmentation**: Splits signals into fixed 30-second windows aligned with expert-annotated hypnogram labels.
- 🧠 **Sleep Stage Mapping**: Converts annotation descriptions to numeric sleep stages (Wake = 0 to REM = 4).
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Architecture**: Implements a CNN for spatial feature extraction followed by an LSTM for temporal context learning.
- 📊 **Visualization**: Includes signal plotting with corresponding sleep stages and accuracy graphs.

## 📚 Dataset

- **Sleep-EDF Expanded Dataset**  
  Available on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/)  
  Includes PSG recordings and corresponding hypnogram annotations in `.edf` format.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `Python`, `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `MNE` for EEG and signal processing  
- `SciPy` for custom signal filtering  
- `TensorFlow / Keras` for model development

## 🧪 Results

The model was able to learn sleep stage transitions and demonstrated promising classification performance on labeled test data with 96% accuracy. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix were used to assess the stage-wise performance.
